## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  width: 400px;

  /* https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/CSS/transform */
  
  transform: scale(1.2, 1.2);
}
```

### Continued development

Refine Flexbox and CSS Grid skills.

### Useful resources

- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This helped me to understand positioning in grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
